Project Description: Employee Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing a dataset consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns from ABC company, with comprehensive information about its employees. 
The goal is to preprocess, analyze, and visualize key insights from the data, including distribution across teams, employee positions, salary expenditures, and age-related trends. 
This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, data analysis, and storytelling with real-world datasets.

Tasks Covered:
1: Preprocessing

Filled missing values in string columns like "College" with "Unknown".
Ensured data consistency by removing duplicates and replacing missing numerical values.
Randomly updated the "Height" column to values between 150 and 180.

2: Analysis

Distribution and percentage split of employees by team.
Employee count segregated by positions.
Predominant age groups among employees.
Team-position combination with the highest salary expenditure.
Correlation between age and salary.

3: Visualizations

Bar charts and pie charts for team distribution, position segregation, and age group analysis.
Heatmap and scatter plot for salary and age correlations.

4: Deliverables
A well-documented Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
Graphical insights highlighting trends and patterns.

Data Story: Insights from Employee Analysis

After carefully analyzing the dataset, several key trends, patterns, and correlations have been uncovered,
shedding light on employee distribution, salary expenditure, and team dynamics. 

Below are the main insights:

1. Employee Distribution Across Teams
The analysis reveals that certain teams have a significantly higher number of employees compared to others.
The Boston Celtics and Utah Jazz emerge as two of the most populated teams.
The percentage split highlights a disparity in workforce distribution, indicating some teams invest more in hiring than others.

2. Segregation of Employees by Position
Positions such as Point Guard (PG) and Shooting Guard (SG) have a higher count of employees, suggesting a trend of investment in backcourt players.
Certain teams prioritize specific positions over others, potentially influenced by team strategy or salary budget constraints.

3. Predominant Age Group
The most dominant age group among employees is 20-30 years, reflecting a preference for younger talent.
Fewer employees fall into the 40+ age range, indicating that teams may focus on recruiting players in their prime years.
The age distribution suggests that experience and potential growth influence hiring trends.

4. Highest Salary Expenditure by Team and Position
Analysis of salary expenditure reveals that certain teams and positions consume the largest portion of the payroll budget.
The highest-paying position aligns with experienced and highly skilled roles such as Centers (C) or Power Forwards (PF), indicating a financial focus
on players crucial to the team's structure.
A significant salary gap exists between positions, showing that certain roles command a higher pay scale based on demand and performance expectations.

6. Correlation Between Age and Salary
There is a positive correlation between age and salary, meaning older employees tend to earn higher salaries.
This suggests that experience plays a role in salary determination, with seasoned employees being compensated for their expertise.
Younger employees tend to start with lower salaries, reinforcing the trend of incremental salary growth based on tenure.

Visual Interpretation:
Bar charts were used to highlight differences in employee numbers across teams and positions.
Pie charts effectively conveyed workforce percentage splits across categories.
Scatter plots showcased correlations between age and salary, indicating trends of salary progression.
A heatmap provided a comprehensive salary expenditure overview, offering a clear understanding of financial investments.

Final Takeaways:
The dataset provides a valuable perspective on employee distribution and financial strategies within the organization. 
Teams with higher employee counts focus on certain positions, while salary expenditures are concentrated among experienced individuals. 
The correlation between age and salary reinforces the idea that career progression directly impacts compensation.
